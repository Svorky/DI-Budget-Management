// Project works. Data base connected and I like that you create table if it is not exist!
// You used the structure for models and controllers. Code is clean and I can easy understand what you want it to do. 
// And thanks for using .gitignore!

// Only issue I found is with expences category. I could not get how to create new one. 

// You have an option ""Add new category"", but when user choose it I guess some kind of input should appear. 
// Otherwise I can not add or change anything. May be it would worth to add default categories that I can work with. 
// Also it leads to an error when you try to add expences withount category:

// This is the args:

// {
//   amount: '230',
//   category: 'addnew',
//   comment: 'Something',
//   date: '2024-07-24T07:53',
//   type: 'expense'
// }

// error: insert into ""records"" returning ""id"", ""amount"", ""category"", ""comment"", ""date"", ""type"" - invalid input syntax for integer: ""addnew""

// Since you created category field in the DB as integer  I got this error. Even if I somehow use your app wrong and I just did not get how to add category this error should be prevented, like, if no category then category = 0. Something like that. 

// All other features works perfectly and the idea is very useful. So I would like to see it fully finished :) As an improvement you can also asdd some simple styles to make it prettier. And I like that you serve your htmls from server - very good job!
